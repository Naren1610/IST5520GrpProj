    "\n",
    "The article provides detail on some interesting findings. Most listings are in Manhattan and Brooklyn, and half of the rentals are for the entire residence as opposed to just a room. In termns of pricing, the average rate is \\$152, 3/4 of the observations are under \\$175 and the minimum night mean is seven nights. In addition it was found that the top host name was \"Michael\". The top rentals tend to be focused on business more so than tourism. Most of the listings are in Manhattan and Brooklyn, which allows access to the major economic and tourist activity.\n"
