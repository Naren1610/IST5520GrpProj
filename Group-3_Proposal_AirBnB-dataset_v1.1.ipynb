    "AirBnB is a PaaS for the short term rental market. Users use the platform to list residences for short term rentals. We noticed that for big cities, such as New York City, there are many host and some may want to use AirBnB for lucrative means. Given location and characteristics of a property, a new host would want to know whether he or she is charging the optimal amount to rent the space to lodgers.\n",

    "We noticed that from the New York City dataset for AirBnB, the categorical variable for location  is too coarse. The descriptor says the location is categorized into five boroughs. For a big city such as New York City, there are a lot of insights missing from a business perspective because neighborhoods vary in propertly drastically even within a single borough. Moreso, the geo-coordinates are to fine for business purposes. To handle this we implement a zip code converter to categorize properies based on their location - Feature Selection."
